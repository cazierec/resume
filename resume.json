        "summary": "I'm a mechanical engineer by education, having spent all of my early career working with  physical problems associated with aircraft maintenance and reliability. Originally I used coding as a hobby and to try to automate various tasks either at work or at home, but I'm now looking to turn that into my profession. I have worked on both long-term, large-scope, campains, as well as high urgency, triage-esque, projects. I enjoy problem solving, and have worked to provide solutions while conscious of labor difficulties, costs, reliability and regulatory requirements, and more.",
