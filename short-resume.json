        "summary": "A mechanical engineer by education, having spent all of my early career fixing physical problems in aircraft maintenance and reliability. I've often used coding as a hobby and to try to automate various tasks either at work or at home, but I'm now looking to turn that into my profession. I have worked on both long-term and large-scope campaigns, in addition to high urgency, triage-esque, projects. I enjoy problem solving, and have worked to provide solutions while being conscious of labor difficulties, costs, reliability and regulatory requirements, and more.",
